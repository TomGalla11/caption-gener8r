just scrape from one account --> train neural network with one caption style
case study 1: humansofny
case study 2: natgeo

another case study = verified accounts
pulled 100 verified accounts from the link below:
https://www.rollingstone.com/interactive/features-the-100-best-instagram-accounts/#betches

mention how kanyedoingthings would result in overfitting / bias if included in our dataset
try to find out if there is a way to check if these 100 users are actually verified and only include them if verified
